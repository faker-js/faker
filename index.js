/* 
   
   this index.js file is used for including the Faker library as a CommonJS module
   
   you can include the Faker library into your existing node.js application by requiring the entire /Faker directory

    var Faker = require(./Faker);
    var randomName = Faker.Name.findName();
 
   you can also simply include the "Faker.js" file which is the auto-generated bundled version of the Faker library
   
    var Faker = require(./customAppPath/Faker);
    var randomName = Faker.Name.findName();

  
  if you plan on modifying the Faker library you should be performing your changes in the /lib/ directory
