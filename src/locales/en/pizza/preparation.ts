  "First, put the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl making sure to put the salt and yeast at opposite sides. Make a well in the centre and add the water and olive oil. Mix it together until a rough dough forms. If it's too sticky you can gradually add a little more flour. Dust a clean work surface with a little flour and knead the dough for around 10 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. If you lightly press your finger on the ball of dough it should spring back up easily. Add ½ tablespoon of olive oil to a large clean bowl and rub all over until the bowl is coated. Shape the dough into a ball and place in the bowl, rub the top of the dough with a tiny amount of olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap (cling film) and leave in a warm place for at least 3-4 hours or until tripled in size.",
  'First, put the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl making sure to put the salt and yeast at opposite sides. Add the water and olive oil and start to mix it together with a spoon or spatula to form a rough dough. Shape the dough into a ball and knead on a lightly floured surface for around 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Shape the dough into a nice round ball and place in a lightly oiled clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and sit the dough in a dry warm place for 2-3 hours or until doubled in size. Once the dough has risen, divide the dough in two and shape into two balls ready for topping.',
  'Add the flour to a large mixing bowl and add the sugar, salt and yeast making sure to not place the yeast directly on the salt. Stir to combine the dried ingredients then make a well in the center and add the warm water and olive oil. Stir to form a dough then tip out onto a clean work surface lightly dusted with flour. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic then place in a clean bowl lightly greased with a little olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to proof for around 3 hours or until tripled in size. Meanwhile, make the sauce, add the olive oil to a large pan or skillet on a medium heat. Add the sliced onion and saute slowly until soft and translucent (5-10 minutes). Once soft add the anchovies and stir, breaking them up as they cook. Saute the onions and anchovies for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and simmer the sauce for 15 minutes. Next, add the cubed cheese with a pinch of salt and pepper and continue to cook the sauce for another 10 minutes, set aside to cool. After the dough has risen, tip it out into a clean work surface lightly dusted with flour and divide into two. Roll each half of dough out into a rectangle big enough to fit a 13x9 inch baking tray, it should be around ½ inch thick. Lightly grease the baking tray with olive oil and place the dough in the tray. Top with half of the prepared sauce making sure to spread it out to the edges. Repeat with the second pizza. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to proof for a second time for two hours or until doubled in size. Pre-heat the oven to 450F/230C. Mix the breadcrumbs, grated pecorino, dried oregano and olive oil in a bowl then sprinkle over each pizza. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, let rest for 5 minutes then cut into slices and serve.',
  "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350F/gas mark 4. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the white pith. Use two small/average sized red bell peppers or one large (in Italy they are extra large so I only need one). Cut the tomatoes in half too. Place them in a large baking tray with 2 cloves of garlic, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until soft and slightly charred. Once roasted, remove the garlic from their skins and place all the veg in a food processor or use an immersion (hand-held) blender and blitz the peppers, tomatoes and garlic until very smooth and thick. Taste and add season if needed. Increase the oven temperature to 225°C/425F/gas mark 7. Sprinkle semolina flour or polenta over your baking tray (the one you're going to bake the pizzas on). Roll out your pizza dough to fit your tray, either round or rectangle and place on the tray. Top the pizza with roasted red pepper sauce then sausage, capers and mozzarella. Bake in a very hot oven for 7-10 minutes or until the crust is crispy and cheese is melted and bubbling. Finish the pizza with a sprinkling of rocket (arugula).",

Divide your dough in half roughly with your hands and place on a lightly floured work surface. Press lightly in the dough to shape it into a rough circle or rectangle then using a rolling pin dusted with flour roll the dough out to fit your tray. The dough should be rolled out as thin as possible without tearing. Remove the pizza tray from the oven and dust lightly with semolina flour. Transfer your dough to the tray and spread with 3 tablespoon of passata, you don’t want to much or your pizza will go soggy. Tear up half the mozzarella with your hands and dot it over the base. Finally, add your toppings over four sections of the pizza. Repeat with the second pizza and bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the cheese has melted and the crust is crispy.",
