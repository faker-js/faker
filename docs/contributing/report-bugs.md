# Report Bugs

If you think you’ve found a bug in Faker, please create a new issue using the [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/issues/new?labels=s%3A+pending+triage%2Cc%3A+bug&template=bug_report.yml).
This allows you to provide steps to reproduce, and allows other users to confirm this is actually a bug.

Please include as much detail as possible to help us properly address your issue.
By including comprehensive information upfront, you assist us in efficiently addressing your concerns.
This approach minimizes the need for follow-up questions and allows us to focus on resolving the issue promptly.

::: info Note
If you just have a question that won’t necessarily result in a change to Faker, such as asking how something works or how to contribute, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/discussions) or stop by our [Discord server](https://chat.fakerjs.dev) instead of filing an issue.
