# Migrating from Faker v5 to v6

[[toc]]

## ESM Support

**New Format**: We're now ESM compatible! We've dropped the Browser bundle in favor of ESM.

So if you'd like to use `Faker` in the **browser**, simply include it using a [JavaScript module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#applying_the_module_to_your_html).

```html
<script type="module">
  import { faker } from 'https://unpkg.com/@faker-js/faker';

  console.log(`${faker.name.firstName()} ${faker.name.lastName()}`);
</script>
```

## Remove all references to `faker` from your project. The new package is located at `@faker-js/faker`

:::warning
You **MUST** swap all references from the `faker` package to the new `@faker-js/faker` package.

In addition to releasing all _future_ versions under the `@faker-js/faker` package namespace, we have also provided all _historical_ versions of Faker.

If you depend on a specific version of Faker you still can reference the version directly.

`npm i @faker-js/faker@5.5.3 -D` will work just fine ðŸ˜„.

## TypeScript

:::tip TypeScript Improvements
Faker now ships with its own types! Remove `@types/faker` from your `package.json` to avoid conflicts.
:::

## Tree-shaking

:::warning
Tree shaking is not yet fully supported due to some structural issues. But we plan to make Faker fully tree-shakable in the future.
:::

For now Faker supports tree-shaking for some parts, and we highly recommend that you take advantage of your bundler's tree-shaking capabilities and change how you import Faker right now.

Instead of using:

```ts
// js
const faker = require('@faker-js/faker');

// ts
import faker from '@faker-js/faker';
```

You should switch to:

```ts
// js
const { faker } = require('@faker-js/faker');

// ts
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
```

If you only need one specific language, we highly recommend to make use of the locale specific imports like:

```ts
// js
const fakerDe = require('@faker-js/faker/locale/de');

// ts
import fakerDe from '@faker-js/faker/locale/de';
```

This is especially true if you're importing Faker in the browser.

Faker is a giant package made up of many megabytes of strings. Only import what you need.

_We plan to load the locales in another way in a future major release._

Happy Faking!
