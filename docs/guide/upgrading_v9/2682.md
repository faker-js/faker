### Remove deprecated faker constructor and deprecated JS backwards compatibility

Removed deprecated faker constructor, so it is not possible anymore to just pass a locale string identifier.

Also removed the accessors and method that were only for JS backwards compatibility.

- `get/set locales`
- `get/set locale`
- `get/set localeFallback`
- `setLocale`

To use the new constructor, you need to pass a locale object like:

```ts
import { Faker, es, base } from '@faker-js/faker';

// A custom faker instance that does not have any fallbacks
const customEsFakerWithoutFallback = new Faker({ locale: es });

// A custom faker instance that has only base-data as fallback, but not english data
const customEsFakerWithFallback = new Faker({ locale: [es, base] });
```
