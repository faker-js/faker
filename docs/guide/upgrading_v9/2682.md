### Remove deprecated faker constructor and deprecated JS backwards compatibility

Removed deprecated faker constructor, so it is not possible anymore to just pass a locale string identifier.

Also removed the accessors and method that were only for JS backwards compatibility.

- `get/set locales`
- `get/set locale`
- `get/set localeFallback`
- `setLocale`
