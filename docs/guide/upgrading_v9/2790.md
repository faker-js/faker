### Fix Tree Shaking

Prior to this version, users had to resort to workarounds by importing specific faker instances from dedicated paths to overcome tree shaking issues.

```ts
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker/locale/de';
```

With the implementation of this fix, such workarounds should no longer be necessary.
That means that you should be able to import different localized faker instances from the root of your package.

```ts
import { fakerDE, fakerES, fakerFR } from '@faker-js/faker';
```

The dedicated import paths will still stay for now, to allow a graduate migration for our users.

While the implementation of this change does not constitute as breaking according to semantic versioning guidelines, it does impact the behavior of users bundlers.
