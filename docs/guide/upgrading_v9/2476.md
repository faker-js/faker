### Direction definitions reorganized

The locale definitions used by `faker.location.direction()`, `faker.location.cardinalDirection()` and `faker.location.ordinalDirection()` have been reorganized.
Previously, they were organized under `definitions.location.direction` and `definitions.location.direction_abbr` and where values were required to be in a specific order.
Now, all values are nested under `definitions.location.direction` with descriptive property names.
If you are using the public methods, no changes are required.
You only need to change your code if you are accessing the raw definitions e.g. in `faker.helpers.fake()`.

| Before                    | After                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `location.direction`      | `location.direction.cardinal` or `location.direction.ordinal`           |
| `location.direction_abbr` | `location.direction.cardinal_abbr` or `location.direction.ordinal_abbr` |
