### Stricter checking for function signature passed to `faker.helpers.multiple` method

The `faker.helpers.multiple` method takes a function reference as its first parameter. Previously you may have written code like this to generate multiple values.

```ts
faker.helpers.multiple(faker.date.past, { count: 2 });
```

However this code has a bug - `faker.helpers.multiple` passes the loop index as the second parameter to the method, which in this case would set the `refDate` of the `faker.date.past()` call to 0, making all dates before 1970.

Instead you should generally use a lambda function like

```ts
faker.helpers.multiple(() => faker.date.past(), { count: 2 });
```

to get the desired behavior. In v9.0, we use stricter type-checking in Typescript to detect when a function is called which is not compatible with `(v: unknown, index: number)` which can cause compile-time errors in places where previously there were potential runtime errors.

**Bad**

```ts
faker.helpers.multiple(faker.person.firstName, ...); // ❗
// In Typescript, this is now a compile time error
// Argument of type '(sex?: "female" | "male" | undefined) => string'
// is not assignable to parameter of type '(v: unknown, index: number) => unknown'.
```

**Good**

```ts
faker.helpers.multiple(() => faker.person.firstName(), ...); // ✔
```

The new types also allow for easier use-cases where the index is part of the generated data e.g. as id.

```ts
faker.helpers.multiple((_, index) => ({ id: index, ...}), ...); // [{id: 0, ...}, ...]
```
