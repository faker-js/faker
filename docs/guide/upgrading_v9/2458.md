### Prices now return more price-like values

The `faker.commerce.price` method now produces values, that also return fractional values.

Old price: 828.00
New price: 828.59

The last digit of the price will adjusted to be more price-like:

- 50% of the time: `9`
- 30% of the time: `5`
- 10% of the time: `0`
- 10% of the time: a random digit from `0` to `9`

We plan to rethink this method some more in the future: [#2579](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/issues/2579)
