### Node 14 and 16 No Longer Supported

Support for Node.js versions 14 and 16 has been discontinued as these versions have reached their [end-of-life](https://github.com/nodejs/Release). Faker.js 9.0 requires a minimum of Node.js version 18.

#### Examples of code-upgrades that are now used:

`replaceAll` is a feature that is only supported by Node >=v15, so this is a breaking change for users that are using Node < v15.  
However, we dropped Node < v18 anyways.
