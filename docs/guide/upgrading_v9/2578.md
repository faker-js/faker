### faker.phone.number `style` replaces explicit `format`

`faker.phone.number()` generates a phone number for the current locale. However, previously there was little control over the generated number, which might or might not include country codes, extensions, white space and punctuation.

If you wanted more control over the number, it was previously necessary to pass an explicit `format` parameter. This has now been removed. Instead, you can consider one of two options:

1. The new `style` parameter has convenient options for common use cases. There are three possible values.

- - `'human'`: (default, existing behavior) A human-input phone number, e.g. `555-770-7727` or `555.770.7727 x1234`
- - `'national'`: A phone number in a standardized national format, e.g. `(555) 123-4567`.
- - `'international'`: A phone number in a E.123 standard international format with country code, e.g. `+15551234567`

The styles are locale-aware, so for example if you use pt_PT, phone numbers suitable for Portugal would be generated.

2. If none of the `style`s match your needs, you can use `faker.string.numeric()` or `faker.helpers.fromRegExp()` to create a custom pattern.
