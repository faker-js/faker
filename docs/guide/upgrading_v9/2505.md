### Jobs definitions reorganized

The locale definitions used by `faker.person.jobTitle()`, `faker.person.jobDescriptor()`, `faker.person.jobArea()` and `faker.person.jobType()` have been reorganized and are no longer nested under `definitions.person.title`. If you are using the public methods, no changes are required. You only need to change your code if you are accessing the raw definitions e.g. in `faker.helpers.fake()`.
