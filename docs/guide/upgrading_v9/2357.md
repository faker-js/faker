# Use High Precision RNG by default

In v9 we switch from a 32 bit random value to a 53 bit random value.
We don't change the underlying algorithm much, but we now consume two seed values each step instead of one.
This affects generated values in three ways:

- In large lists or long numbers the values are spread more evenly.
  This also reduces the number of duplicates it generates.
  For `faker.number.int()` this reduces the duplicates from `1/10k` to less than `1/8kk`.
- Some seeded runs now return slightly different values, due to the last digits of random numbers changing,
  some methods now generate slightly different results.
- Subsequent values change their values. Because the generator now takes two values each,
  the values afterwards are different from before.
  If then generator previously generated `1,2,3,4,5`, it now generates `1,3,5,7,9`.

## Adoption

If you don't have any seeded tests and just want some random values, then you don't have to change anything.

If you have seeded tests, you have to update most test snapshots or similar comparisons to new values.

If you are using vitest, you can do that using `pnpm vitest run -u`.

## Keeping the old behavior

You can keep the old behavior, if you create your own `Faker` instance
and pass a `Randomizer` instance from the `generateMersenne32Randomizer()` function to it.

```ts
const faker = new Faker({
  randomizer: generateMersenne32Randomizer(),
  ...
});
```
