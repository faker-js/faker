A lot of effort has been put into `Faker` to create a useful and handy library.
There are still a lot of things to be done, so all contributions are welcome!
If you want to make `Faker` a better, please read the following contribution guide.

# Important

- Please make sure that you run `pnpm install`, `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run test` before making a PR to ensure that everything is working from the start.

## Good to know

- The project is being built by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) (see [bundle.ts](scripts/bundle.ts))
- The documentation is running via VitePress.
  Make sure you **build** the project before running the docs, cause some files depend on `dist`.
  Use `pnpm run docs:dev` to edit them in live mode.
- The tests are executing `vitest` against `test/**/*.spec.ts`
- If you update the locales, make sure to run `pnpm run generate:locales` to generate/update the related files.

## Architecture

The sources are located in the [src](src) directory.
All fake data generators are divided into namespaces (each namespace being a separate module).
Most of the generators use the _definitions_, which are just plain JavaScript objects/arrays/strings that are separate for each [locale](src/locales).

## Building Faker

The project is being built by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) (see [bundle.ts](scripts/bundle.ts))

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

## Testing

Before you can run the tests, you need to install all dependencies and build the project, because some tests depend on the bundled content.

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run build

pnpm run test
# or
pnpm run coverage
```

You can view a generated code coverage report at `coverage/index.html`.

## Adding new locale or updating existing one

After adding new or updating existing locale data, you need to run `pnpm run generate:locales` to generate/update the related files.

## Deprecation workflow

If you ever find yourself deprecating some parts in the source code you can follow this steps to save yourself (and the reviewers) some trouble.

If the code you want to deprecate is a property, convert it to a [getter](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#getters--setters) first. Now that you have a function the first thing you want to do is call the internal [`deprecated` function](src/internal/deprecated.ts). Afterwards add a `@deprecated` parameter to the end of the JSDoc with human readable description message on how to replace current implementations. Lastly add a `@see` parameter to the JSDoc with a link to the replacement in the faker library if it exist. The syntax for the link is `faker.[module].[function]`.

Example:

```ts
/**
 * @see faker.cat.random
 *
 * @deprecated Use faker.cat.random() instead.
 */
get cat() {
  deprecated({
    deprecated: 'faker.animal.cat()',
  });
  return 'cat';
}
```

## Developing the docs

Before running the docs, build the Faker dist, it's used inside of certain routes.

```shell
pnpm run build

pnpm run docs:dev
```

## Building and serving the docs statically

If you changed something heavily in the docs, like auto-generating content, you should check the docs statically, because it could differ from the dev version.
Before running the docs, build the Faker dist, it's used inside of certain routes.

```shell
pnpm run build

pnpm run docs:build # Output docs to /dist
pnpm run docs:serve # Serve docs from /dist
```

## Deploying documentation

See the [netlify.toml](netlify.toml) for configuration.
